### VAT Withholding and Firms' Trade Relations
This paper estimates the effect of tax withholding on firms's trade relations, exploiting a reform to the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) implemented in Italy in 2015. Analyzing confidential data on firm-to-firm transactions for nearly 100,000 firms, I present two main findings. First, tax withholding creates a large increase in the credit position vis-Ã -vis the tax authority among treated firms. The reform increases the proportion of firms that register a credit at the end of the tax year by 6 percentage points, a 10 percent increase. Second, I find that firms are more likely to stop dealing with their clients subject to the new withholding rules. After the reform, firm-to-firm transactions subject to VAT withholding are 5 percentage points more likely to be severed, compared to links not affected by the reform. This paper provides empirical evidence against the canonical proposition that remittance responsibility is irrelavant to the consequences of a tax and describes the behavioral response of firms.

### Importing Inequality: Globalisation and Top Income Growth, *with Arun Advani, Felix Koenig, Andy Summers*
Top incomes have risen dramatically in Anglo-Saxon countries in recent decades, while such growth was modest in most continental European countries. This paper studies the extent to which growth in UK top income shares is explained by the sorting of top earners across countries. Income tax returns on the full population of UK top earners are used to account for selection effects at the top of the income distribution. Accounting for migration of top earners sheds light on the cause of top income growth, can explain differences in top income growth across countries, brings models of top income inequality closer in line with the data, and alters the optimal design of tax schedules.
