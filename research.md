### Who Writes the Check to the Government Does Matter: Evidence from Firm-to-Firm Links
This paper provides empirical evidence against the irrelevance proposition and quantifies the behavioral response of firms to a change in the responsibility to remit Value Added Tax (VAT). Combining administrative data on firm-to-firm links from Italy and a quasi-experimental design, I find that inverting statutory incidence of VAT from the buyer to the seller worsened the buyer's outcomes and distorted its choice of trading partners. Firms that had pre-reform relations with affected clients are more likely to become inactive, experienced a decline in revenues and purchases, while their tax base remained broadly unchanged. Moreover, these businesses were more likely to sever links that are subject to new rules on VAT remittance. Consistent with a response triggered by a combination of evasion or cash-flow considerations, smaller firms reacted more strongly and exhibited worse outcomes after the introduction of the reform, while outcomes of larger firms are unchanged.

In this paper we study the contribution of migrants to the rise in UK top incomes. Using administrative data on the universe of UK taxpayers we show migrants are concentrated at the top of the income distribution, with migrants twice as prevalent in the top 0.1 percent as anywhere in the bottom 96 percent. These high incomes are predominantly from labour, rather than capital, and migrants are concentrated in only a handful of industries, predominantly finance. Almost all (85%) of the growth in the UK top 1% income share over the past 20 years can be attributed to migration.
