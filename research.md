### Who Writes the Check to the Government Does Matter: Evidence from Firm-to-Firm Links
This paper provides empirical evidence against the irrelevance proposition and quantifies the behavioral response of firms to a change in the responsibility to remit Value Added Tax (VAT). Combining administrative data on firm-to-firm links from Italy and a quasi-experimental design, I find that inverting statutory incidence of a tax from the buyer to the seller worsened the buyer's outcomes and distorted its choice of trading partners. Firms that had pre-reform relations with affected clients are more likely to become inactive, experienced a decline in revenues and purchases, while their tax base remained broadly unchanged. Moreover, these businesses were more likely to sever links that are subject to new rules on VAT remittance. Consistent with a response triggered by a combination of evasion or cash-flow considerations, smaller firms reacted more strongly and exhibited worse outcomes after the introduction of the reform, while outcomes of larger firms are unchanged.

### Importing Inequality: The Rise of Foreign Top Earners in the UK
(joint with Arun Advani, Felix Koenig, and Andy Summers)     
Top incomes have risen dramatically in Anglo-Saxon countries in recent decades, while such growth was modest in most continental European countries. This paper studies the extent to which growth in UK top income shares is explained by the sorting of top earners across countries. Income tax returns on the full population of UK top earners are used to account for selection effects at the top of the income distribution. Accounting for migration of top earners sheds light on the cause of top income growth, can explain differences in top income growth across countries, brings models of top income inequality closer in line with the data, and alters the optimal design of tax schedules.
