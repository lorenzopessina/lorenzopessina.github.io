<p>I am a sixth year PhD student in economics at Columbia University in New York and I am on the job market. </p>

<p> My main research field is public economics, with a focus on taxation of businesses and inequality. I am also interested in migration and empirical corporate finance. </p>
          
<p class="bottom-space">
In my <strong>job market paper</strong>, I use administrative data to analyze how transactions, firms and markets adapt to changes in the way taxes are collected by the government.
</p>

<p>I will be available for interviews at the <strong>2020 Virtual EEA Meeting</strong> in Nottingham and at the <strong>2021 Virtual ASSA Meetings</strong> in Chicago.</p>
