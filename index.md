I am a fifth year PhD student in economics at **Columbia University** in New York.

My research focuses on **public economics** and **tax policy**. I use administrative data to analyze how firms adapt to changes in the way taxes are collected by the government.         
In another set of projects, I investigate the prevalence of **migrants** at the top of the income distribution and their contribution to increases in **income inequality** in the UK. 

My CV is [here](https://lorenzopessina.com/cv/Pessina_cv.pdf).
