I am a fifth year PhD student in economics at **Columbia University** in New York.

<p class="bottom-space">
My research focuses on <strong>public economics</strong> and <strong>tax policy</strong>. I use administrative data to analyze how firms adapt to changes in the way taxes are collected by the government.
</p>
<p class="bottom-space">
In another set of projects, I investigate the prevalence of <strong>migrants</strong> at the top of the income distribution and their contribution to increases in <strong>income inequality</strong> in the UK.
